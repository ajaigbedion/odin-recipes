        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Fried whole fish (or fish steaks from larger fish) served with a sauteed mixture of pickled dressings and peppers. Delicious, low-investment and healthy!</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fish:</strong> This dish requires fresh whole fish or fish steaks. Common fish used for this dish include <em>red snapper</em>, <em>whiting</em>, <em>kingfish</em>, and <em>bluefish</em>. Any firm white fleshed fish will do however.</li> <!--Add more context-->
            <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> An assortment of <em>carrots</em>, <em>onions</em> and a mix of <em>red</em>, <em>green</em>, <em>yellow</em>, and <em>orange bell peppers</em> julienned, sliced or cut into otherwise thin strips</li>
            <li><strong>Garnish:</strong> <em>Thyme</em> and <em>green onions</em> (also known as <em>"scallions"</em> in other circles) are added to the mix to further enhance flavor and give color variety.</li> <!--Add more context-->
            <li><strong>Vinegar:</strong> White distilled vinegar is necessary to pickle the vegetables and form the sauce to be served with the fish.</li> <!--Add more context-->
            <li><strong>Hot Peppers:</strong> <em>Scotch Bonnett</em> peppers are used and form the basis of the spice in this dish. Use caution with these however as they can be quite intense if you are not used to pepper. The intensity of the pepper is tied to its color with green sitting lower on the spectrum and red sitting at the top.</li> <!--Add more context-->
            <li><strong>Salt, Black Pepper & Ground Pimento:</strong> Fish should be seasoned with a mixture of these (for best effect, make an incision in the side of fish and apply mixture of these seasonings into said cuts before frying. The longer the better!)..</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>Here's a very brief run down of how to prepare this dish:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Season the fish:</strong> After cleaning the fish, dry it. You may use a paper towel to remove all the water from the fish. You are frying the fish crispy brown, so you don’t want the fish wet or cold. Combine the salt and black pepper to make the fish seasoning. Rub the seasoning all over and into the fish.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil:</strong> You don’t need a lot of cooking oil to pan-fry fish, but the temperature of the oil is essential to make the fish crispy. Bring the oil near the smoke point before adding the fish. Also, place the pimento berries, scotch bonnet and slice garlic in the oil before adding the fish to the oil.</li> 
            <li><strong>Fry fish:</strong> Once the garlic starts to brown, add the fish to the oil. Fry on both sides until crispy brown. After placing the fish in the oil, turn the heat down so the fish don’t brown before it cook inside.</li>
            <li><strong>Vegetable slices:</strong> You want thinly sliced vegetables for the escovitch sauce. Slice the carrot into thin strips and chop the whole onion to get the ring slices. The more scotch bonnet pepper you use, the spicier the escovitch sauce. I suggest removing the pepper seed as it is the hottest part of the pepper. One scotch bonnet is enough for the recipe below, but use two if you are a daredevil like myself.</li>
            <li><strong>Escovitch sauce:</strong> In the same pan, you fry the fish, sauté the carrot, onion, pimento (allspice) and scotch bonnet pepper for about 2 minutes. Add the vinegar, sugar and a pinch of salt and cook for another 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Escovitch fish:</strong>  Pour the sauce over and leave it to sit. The best time to eat the Escovitch fish is the day after when the fish have absorbed all the flavour from the pickled sauce.</li>
        </ol>
